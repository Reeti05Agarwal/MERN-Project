When first starting a penetration test or any secuirty evaluation on the target, primary step is known as enumeration

if (target== web server)
then navigate to its IP address to see what the oage contains

if (target == storage server)
then connect to it using same ip address to explore files and folders stored on it with necessary credentials. 

# steps in enumeration

1. scanning the open ports
	nmap
2. Manually access each of the opne port to find out if we have access to their content or not. Different services will use diff tools or scripts to be accessed.
