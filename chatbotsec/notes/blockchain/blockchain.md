# Blockchain Dev

Blockchain Tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of blockchain. Blockchain is a constantly growing **ledger** that keeps a **permanent** record of all the transactions that have taken place in a **secure**, **chronological**, and **immutable** way. It can be used for the secure transfer of money, property, contracts, etc. without requiring a third-party intermediary such as bank or government. Blockchain is a software protocol, but it could not be run without the Internet (like SMTP is for email).
So basically you are logging in your wallet instead of your emails. You are having interacting peer to peer between different users without any central intermediatory. 
you can own your data. right now you are posying your data in the servers. Youso we are going to have a model of internet thats going to monetizze data and give more control customization and automation with wallets as a central point of control holding tokens.
Shared Global Ledger as a single Source of truth for records etched in time aka timechain.
in Ledgers, first you need to represent assets on it in order to use shared global ledger. 

Tokenization: The process of representing tokens on the blockchain.
Tokens: Representation of objects on the shared global ledger known as blockchain.
Cryptocurrency: Native Tokens of a ledger used to pay transaction fees for utilising the ledger. Its a form of token issued on that ledger which acts as a virtual currency which funds the transaction of teh blockchain. which funds the transaction of teh blockchain because maintaing the blockchain requires maintaining the servers that need to be paid.

In ledgers, the sequence of transactions matters a lot. Its important of transactions to be appended or added in teh sequence is what created an append only ledger. that is an auditable Ledger that is having consensus between different parties. because the ledger is getting maintained by diff computers across the world but they still need to have a single source of truth which tells the sequence of transaction. The blockchain solution was to create a distributed timestamp server, essentially the timestamps messages that is coming in a distributed network and have consensus achieved in that distributed network but it does not have concensus among different parties because you are all peer to peer and there is no central ledger coming here, here we are adding a central ledger that needs to have a concensus. 

# Need of Blockchain

- **Time reduction:** In the financial industry, blockchain can allow the quicker settlement of trades. It does not take a lengthy process for verification, settlement, and clearance. It is because of a single version of agreed-upon data available between all stakeholders.
- **Unchangeable transactions:** Blockchain register transactions in a chronological order which certifies the unalterability of all operations, means when a new block is added to the chain of ledgers, it cannot be removed or modified.
- **Reliability:** Blockchain certifies and verifies the identities of each interested parties. This removes double records, reducing rates and accelerates transactions.
- **Security:** Blockchain uses very advanced cryptography to make sure that the information is locked inside the blockchain. It uses Distributed Ledger Technology where each party holds a copy of the original chain, so the system remains operative, even the large number of other nodes fall.
- **Collaboration:** It allows each party to transact directly with each other without requiring a third-party intermediary.
- **Decentralized:** It is decentralized because there is no central authority supervising anything. There are standards rules on how every node exchanges the blockchain information. This method ensures that all transactions are validated, and all valid transactions are added one by one.

# Version

## Blockchain 1.0: Currency

The idea of creating money through solving computational puzzles was first introduced in **2005** by **Hal Finney**, who created the first concept for cryptocurrencies (The implementation of distributed ledger technology). This ledger allows financial transactions based on blockchain technology or DLT to be executed with [Bitcoin](https://www.javatpoint.com/bitcoin). Bitcoin is the most prominent example in this segment. It is being used as **cash for the Internet** and seen as the enabler of an **Internet of Money**.

## Blockchain 2.0: Smart Contracts

The main issues that came with Bitcoin are wasteful mining and lack of network scalability. To overcome these issues, this version extends the concept of Bitcoin beyond currency. The new key concepts are Smart Contracts. It is small computer programs that **"live"** in the [blockchain](https://www.javatpoint.com/blockchain-tutorial). They are free computer programs which executed automatically and checked conditions which are defined earlier like facilitation, verification or enforcement. The big advantage of this technology that blockchain offers, making it impossible to tamper or hack Smart Contracts. A most prominent example is the Ethereum Blockchain, which provides a platform where the developer community can build distributed applications for the Blockchain network.

Quickly, the blockchain 2.0 version is successfully processing a high number of daily transactions on a public network, where millions were raised through **ICO** (Initial Coin Offerings), and the market cap increased rapidly.

## Blockchain 3.0: DApps

DApps is also known as a decentralized application. It uses decentralized storage and communication. Its backend code is running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. A DApp can have **frontend code** hosted on decentralized storages such as Ethereum Swarm and **user interfaces** written in any language that can make a call to its backend like a traditional Apps.

# Building of Blockchain

The role of a minor is to build the blockchain of records that forms the bitcoin ledger. These ledgers are called blocks, and each block contains all the different transactions that have taken place. A new block is added in every 10 minutes as a new Bitcoin Transaction takes place. So, as the minors process these different transactions, they build the block, and when a block is confirmed, it gets added to the blockchain. The bitcoin blockchain provides a permanent record of all bitcoin transactions to the beginning.


## Application

1. **Storing cryptocurrencies:** Blockchain wallets are mostly used to securely store bitcoins. Because the wallet employs private and public keys, only the wallet owner has access to and management of the cryptocurrency stored in the wallet.
2. **Sending and receiving cryptocurrencies:** Blockchain wallets allow users to quickly transfer and receive bitcoins. Users may transfer bitcoin to anybody having a cryptocurrency wallet address, no matter where they are in the globe.
3. **Online shopping:**Blockchain wallets may be used to perform cryptocurrency-based online purchases. This function eliminates the need for traditional payment methods and increases the security of online purchase.
4. **Investment:** Blockchain wallets can be used to invest in cryptocurrencies, allowing individuals to participate in a decentralized asset class that is not controlled by any central authority.
5. **Remittances:** Blockchain wallets enable international money transfers without the involvement of middlemen such as banks or financial organizations. This function avoids the need for costly foreign currency fees and lowers transaction expenses.
6. **Decentralized applications:** Blockchain wallets can be used to access the Blockchain network's decentralized apps (DApps). DApps are decentralized apps that are not controlled by a central authority and allow users to connect with digital services in a secure and transparent manner.
