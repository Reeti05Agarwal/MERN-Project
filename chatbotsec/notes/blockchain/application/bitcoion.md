# Bitcoin

irreversible payment system
natural currency, all countries have same type of currency

A bitcoin is a type of digital assets which can be bought, sold, and transfer between the two parties securely over the internet. Bitcoin can be used to store values much like fine gold, silver, and some other type of investments. We can also use bitcoin to buy products and services as well as make payments and exchange values electronically. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency(virtual currency), or a **digital currency** that uses rules of cryptography for regulation and generation of units of currency. A Bitcoin fell under the scope of [cryptocurrency](https://www.javatpoint.com/blockchain-cryptocurrency) and became the first and most valuable among them. It is commonly called **decentralized digital currency**.

When you send an email to another person, you just type an email address and can communicate directly to that person. It is the same thing when you send an instant message. This type of communication between two parties is commonly known as Peer-to-Peer communication.

Whenever you want to transfer money to someone over the internet, you need to use a service of third-party such as banks, a credit card, a PayPal, or some other type of money transfer services. The reason for using third-party is to ensure that you are transferring that money. In other words, you need to be able to verify that both parties have done what they need to do in real exchange.

**For example**, Suppose you click on a photo that you want to send it to another person, so you can simply attach that photo to an email, type the receiver email address and send it. The other person will receive the photo, and you think it would end, but it is not. Now, we have two copies of photo, one is a simple email, and another is an original file which is still on my computer. Here, we send the copy of the file of the photo, not the original file. This issue is commonly known as the double-spend problem.

The double-spend problem provides a challenge to determine whether a transaction is real or not. How you can send a bitcoin to someone over the internet without needing a bank or some other institution to certify the transfer took place. The answer arises in a global network of thousands of computers called a Bitcoin Network and a special type of decentralized laser technology called **blockchain**.

In Bitcoin, all the information related to the transaction is captured securely by using maths, protected cryptographically, and the data is stored and verified across the entire network of computers. In other words, instead of having a centralized database of the third-party such as banks to certify the transaction took place. Bitcoin uses [blockchain](https://www.javatpoint.com/blockchain-tutorial) technology across a decentralized network of computers to securely verify, confirm and record each transaction. Since data is stored in a decentralized manner across a wide network, there is no single point of failure. This makes blockchain more secure and less prone to fraud, tampering or general system failure than keeping them in a single centralized location.

# Role of botcoin minors

Within the bitcoin networks, there are a group of people known as Miners.  these minors use very powerful computers that are specifically designed to mine [bitcoin](https://www.javatpoint.com/bitcoin) transaction. They do this by actually solving math problems and resolving cryptographic issues because every transaction needs to be cryptographically encoded and secured. These mathematical problems ensure that nobody is tampering with that data.

Additionally, for this task, the minors are paid in bitcoins, which is the key component in bitcoin. In Bitcoin, you cannot create money as like you create regular fiat currencies such as Dollar, Euro, and Yuan. The bitcoin is created by rewarding these minors for their work in solving the mathematical and cryptographical problems.

# **Basic Components**

1. Software
    
    defines what a bitcoin is, as well as how a bitcoin gets transferred.
    
    Identifies the rules of valid bitcoin
    
2. Cryptography
    
    to regulate the transfer of bitcoin between parties, as well as the creation of new units of bitcoin.
    
3. Hardware
    
    To run and solve cryptography, it needs HARDWARE. This hardware is composed of those thousands of miners around the world running their computers. So there are thousands of computers around the world that are basically running the Bitcoin software or the Bitcoin client. This hardware is specially designed for finding Nonce to validate block and hash. It requires a lot of CPU power to complete a simple task on the bitcoin blockchain.
    
    If you try to mine bitcoin right now with your smartphone or home computer, then you will End up losing your computer along with a hefty electric bill.
    
4. Miners(Gaming Theory)
    
    Miners are users who involved in a gaming theory because bitcoin is truly a game which is run by these miners around the world. In the above, we have seen that the first component is **software for bitcoin** that issues a cryptography challenge in every 10 minutes. The cryptography challenge involves in trying to find a Nonce which will make the hash for a specific block valid. All the hashes and validations are done by these miners. After successful creation of the block, the new block is added to the blockchain.
    
    - Bitcoin software creates a challenge. Now, there is a game begins, and there is a race that goes off. The race involves all these miners competing against each other to solve the challenges.
    - This task or challenge will take approximately 10 minutes to be completed.
    - Every single miner starts trying to find the solution to that one Nonce that will satisfy the hash for the block.
    - At some specific point, one of those miners in the global community with higher speed and great hardware specs will solve the cryptography challenge and be the winner of that race.
    - Now, the rest of the community will start verifying that block which is mined by the winner. This makes Bitcoin so strong, because in one stage of this cycle, the miners are competing against each other, and in the next stage of the cycle, the rest of the community rallies together to ensure that that solution is correct.
    - If the Nonce is correct, it will end up with the new block which will be added to the blockchain.
    - For this task or challenge, the winner will earn a reward. That reward is currently 12.5 bitcoins.
