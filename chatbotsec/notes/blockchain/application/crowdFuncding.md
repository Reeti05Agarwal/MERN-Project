# Disadv of Conventional crowdfunding

The conventional crowdfunding strategy does, however, have several drawbacks, including expensive fees, regional constraints, and a lack of transparency. Blockchain technology can provide a safer and more effective method of crowdfunding in this situation.

1. **Transparency:** Transparency is one of the main benefits of adopting blockchain technology for crowdfunding. Multiple network nodes record and confirm each transaction on the blockchain. This ensures that there is no fraudulent behavior by creating a clear and unchangeable record of all transactions.
2. **Reduced Fees:** Traditional crowdfunding sites have significant service costs, which might reduce the amount of money businesses are able to raise. On the other side, peer-to-peer networks are used by blockchain-based crowdfunding platforms, which do away with the necessity for middlemen. Because of the cheaper costs as a consequence, businesses may keep more of the money they raise.
3. **Global Reach:** Entrepreneurs find it challenging to reach a worldwide audience thanks to the geographical constraints that sometimes limit traditional crowdfunding platforms. However, blockchain-based crowdfunding platforms run on a decentralized network, enabling business owners to freely access a worldwide audience.
4. **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts that automatically carry out the terms of an agreement when specific criteria are satisfied, are another feature of blockchain technology that may be used. Smart contracts may be used to automate the crowdfunding process, making sure that money is only paid to the business owner after reaching predetermined milestones.
5. **Tokenization:** Digital tokens may be created using blockchain technology to signify ownership in a business or project. Through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), these tokens may be used to raise money. Using ICOs, business owners may generate money rapidly and effectively without the use of conventional middlemen.

1. **Lack of regulation:** Crowdfunding in blockchain technology is relatively new and lacks regulatory oversight, which may expose investors to higher risks.
2. **Volatility:** Cryptocurrencies and digital tokens are often highly volatile, exposing investors to a higher level of risk than traditional investments.
3. **Lack of transparency:** While blockchain technology provides transparency, some crowdfunding campaigns may lack information about the underlying project or venture, exposing investors to the risk of investing in a poorly conceived or fraudulent project.
4. **Limited liquidity:** While tokenization provides investors with a more liquid asset, some digital tokens may be difficult to sell or trade, leading to a lack of liquidity.
5. **Crowding out:** Crowdfunding in blockchain technology may lead to the crowding out of traditional investment channels, limiting access to capital for entrepreneurs who are not familiar with or cannot access blockchain-based crowdfunding platforms.
