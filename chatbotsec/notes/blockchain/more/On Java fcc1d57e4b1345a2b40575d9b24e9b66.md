# On Java

The Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, and Corda blockchain frameworks are just a few of the ones that run on Java. 

To implement a blockchain in Java using Hyperledger Fabric, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Set up a development environment:** A development environment that contains the Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Java and the required dependencies must be set up.
2. **Define the network:** The network topology, including the nodes, channels, and smart contracts, must be specified.
3. **Develop the smart contracts:** Java must be used to create the smart contracts. The business logic that governs transactions and operates on the blockchain is known as a smart contract.
4. **Build the application:** We must create the software that communicates with the blockchain network. The Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Java may be used for this.
5. **Test and deploy:** The application has to be evaluated before being launched onto the blockchain network.
