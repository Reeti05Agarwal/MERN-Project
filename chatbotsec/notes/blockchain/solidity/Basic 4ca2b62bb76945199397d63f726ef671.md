# Basic

- **Why No Print Statements?**
    - Solidity code runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is a global, decentralized network of computers that execute and validate the code.
    - Printing messages like we do in regular programs isn't practical in this environment because the EVM is focused on maintaining a shared state across all nodes rather than interacting with a single user's console.
    - In programming languages like Python or JavaScript, you can use print statements to show messages on the screen. For example, `print("Hello, world!")` would show the message "Hello, world!".
    - Solidity, the language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, doesn't have print statements.

# Structure

```bash
pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.6.0;
contract SimpleStorage {
   uint storedData;
   function set(uint x) public {
      storedData = x;
   }
   function get() public view returns (uint) {
      return storedData;
   }
}
```

## **Version Pragma**

All solidity source code should start with a “version pragma” which is a declaration of the version of the solidity compiler this code should use.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.9.0;
```

Here the second condition is added by using ^.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
```

## **Contract**

A Solidity contract is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereumblockchain.

```solidity
contract Test
{ 
		//Functions and Data 
}
```

The line uintstoredData declares a state variable called storedData of type uint and the functions set and get can be used to modify or retrieve the value of the variable.

## Importing Lib

```solidity
import "file_name";
```

To import a file x from the same directory as the current file, use import `./x` as x;. If you use import "x" as x; instead, a different file could be referenced in a global "include directory".

```solidity
import "./MyLibrary.sol";
```

The following example creates a new global symbol symbolName whose members are all the global symbols from "filename".

```solidity
import * as symbolName from "filename";
```

## Comments

```solidity
		// This is a comment. It is similar to comments in C++

   /*
      * This is a multi-line comment in solidity
      * It is very similar to comments in C Programming
   */
```

### Address

`address` holds the 20 byte value representing the size of an Ethereum address. An address can be used to get the balance using `.balance` method and can be used to transfer balance to another address using `.transfer` method.

```solidity
address x = 0x212;
address myAddress = this;
if (x.balance < 10 && myAddress.balance >= 10) x.transfer(10);
```

# Value Types

| **Type** | **Keyword** | **Values** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Boolean | bool | true/false |
| Integer | int/uint | Signed and unsigned integers of varying sizes. |
| Integer | int8 to int256 | Signed int from 8 bits to 256 bits. int256 is the same as int. |
| Integer | uint8 to uint256 | Unsigned int from 8 bits to 256 bits. uint256 is the same as uint. |
| Fixed Point Numbers | fixed/unfixed | Signed and unsigned fixed point numbers of varying sizes. |
| Fixed Point Numbers | fixed/unfixed | Signed and unsigned fixed point numbers of varying sizes. |
| Fixed Point Numbers | fixedMxN | Signed fixed point number where M represents number of bits taken by type and N represents the decimal points. M should be divisible by 8 and goes from 8 to 256. N can be from 0 to 80. fixed is same as fixed128x18. |
| Fixed Point Numbers | ufixedMxN | Unsigned fixed point number where M represents number of bits taken by type and N represents the decimal points. M should be divisible by 8 and goes from 8 to 256. N can be from 0 to 80. ufixed is same as ufixed128x18. |

# Types of Variable

## State Variable

Variables whose values are permanently stored in a contract storage.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
contract SolidityTest {
   uint storedData;      // State variable
   constructor() public {
      storedData = 10;   // Using State variable
   }
}
```

### Public

Public state variables can be accessed internally as well as via messages. For a public state variable, an automatic getter function is generated.

### Internal

Internal state variables can be accessed only internally from the current contract or contract deriving from it without using this.

### Private

Private state variables can be accessed only internally from the current contract they are defined not in the derived contract from it.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
contract C {
   uint public data = 30;
   uint internal iData= 10;
   
   function x() public returns (uint) {
      data = 3; // internal access
      return data;
   }
}
contract Caller {
   C c = new C();
   function f() public view returns (uint) {
      return c.data(); //external access
   }
}
contract D is C {
   function y() public returns (uint) {
      iData = 3; // internal access
      return iData;
   }
   function getResult() public view returns(uint){
      uint a = 1; // local variable
      uint b = 2;
      uint result = a + b;
      return storedData; //access the state variable
   }
}
```

## Local Variable

Variables whose values are available only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
contract SolidityTest {
   uint storedData; // State variable
   constructor() public {
      storedData = 10;   
   }
   function getResult() public view returns(uint){
      uint a = 1; // local variable
      uint b = 2;
      uint result = a + b;
      return result; //access the local variable
   }
}
```

## Global Variable

These are special variables which exist in global workspace and provide information about the blockchain and transaction properties.

| **Name** | **Returns** |
| --- | --- |
| blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32) | Hash of the given block - only works for 256 most recent, excluding current, blocks |
| block.coinbase (address payable) | Current block miner's address |
| block.difficulty (uint) | Current block difficulty |
| block.gaslimit (uint) | Current block gaslimit |
| block.number (uint) | Current block number |
| block.timestamp (uint) | Current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch |
| gasleft() returns (uint256) | Remaining gas |
| msg.data (bytes `calldata`) | Complete `calldata` |
| msg.sender (address payable) | Sender of the message (current caller) |
| msg.sig (bytes4) | First four bytes of the calldata (function identifier) |
| msg.value (uint) | Number of wei sent with the message |
| now (uint) | Current block timestamp |
| tx.gasprice (uint) | Gas price of the transaction |
| tx.origin (address payable) | Sender of the transaction |

## **Bytes to String Conversion**

> `string()` constructor
> 

```solidity
bytes memory bstr = new bytes(10);
string message = string(bstr);  
```

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract SolidityTest {   
   constructor() public{       
   }
   function getResult() public view returns(string memory){
      uint a = 1; 
      uint b = 2;
      uint result = a + b;
      return integerToString(result); 
   }
   function integerToString(uint _i) internal pure 
      returns (string memory) {
      
      if (_i == 0) {
         return "0";
      }
      uint j = _i;
      uint len;
      
      while (j != 0) {
         len++;
         j /= 10;
      }
      bytes memory bstr = new bytes(len);
      uint k = len - 1;
      
      while (_i != 0) {
         bstr[k--] = byte(uint8(48 + _i % 10));
         _i /= 10;
      }
      return string(bstr);
   }
}
```

# Array

collection of variables of the same type. 

In Solidity, an array can be of compile-time fixed size or of dynamic size. For storage array, it can have different types of elements as well. In case of memory array, element type can not be mapping and in case it is to be used as function parameter then element type should be an ABI type. 

All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.

fixed size:

```solidity
type arrayName [ arraySize ];
```

```solidity
uint balance[3] = [1, 2, 3];
```

dynamic size:

```solidity
type[] arrayName;
```

```solidity
uint size = 3;
uint balance[] = new uint[](size);
```

## Members

### Length

length returns the size of the array. length can be used to change the size of dynamic array be setting it.

### Push

push allows to append an element to a dynamic storage array at the end. It returns the new length of the array.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract test {
   function testArray() public pure{
   //The pure keyword indicates that the function 
   //does not read or modify the contract's state.
   
      uint len = 7; 
      
      //dynamic array
      uint[] memory a = new uint[](7);
      
      //bytes is same as byte[]
      bytes memory b = new bytes(len);
      //This creates a dynamic array b of type bytes 
      //with a length of len (which is 7), stored in memory. 
      //In Solidity, bytes is an alias for byte[].
      
      assert(a.length == 7);
      assert(b.length == len);
      
      //access array variable
      a[6] = 8;
      
      //test array variable
      assert(a[6] == 8);
      
      //static array
      uint[3] memory c = [uint(1) , 2, 3];
      assert(c.length == 3);
   }
}
```

```solidity
uint[] memory a = new uint[](7);
```

- **`uint[]`**: This declares an array of unsigned integers.
- **`memory`**: This keyword indicates that the array `a` is stored in memory. Memory in Solidity is a temporary place to store data, meaning that the data will only persist for the duration of the function call.
- **`a`**: This is the name of the array variable.
- **`new uint`** : This initializes the array `a` with 7 elements, all of which are initially set to zero.

```solidity
bytes memory b = new bytes(len);
```

This creates a dynamic array b of type bytes with a length of len (which is 7), stored in memory.  In Solidity, bytes is an alias for byte[].

```solidity
assert(a.length == 7);
```

The `assert` function will cause the transaction to revert if the condition is not met.

# Enum

Enums restrict a variable to have one of only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are called enums.

With the use of enums it is possible to reduce the number of bugs in your code.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract test {
   enum FreshJuiceSize{ SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE }
   FreshJuiceSize choice;
   FreshJuiceSize constant defaultChoice = FreshJuiceSize.MEDIUM;

   function setLarge() public {
      choice = FreshJuiceSize.LARGE;
   }
   function getChoice() public view returns (FreshJuiceSize) {
      return choice;
   }
   function getDefaultChoice() public pure returns (uint) {
      return uint(defaultChoice);
   }
}
```

# Structs

Struct types are used to represent a record.

```solidity
struct struct_name { 
   type1 type_name_1;
   type2 type_name_2;
   type3 type_name_3;
}
```

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract test {
   struct Book { 
      string title;
      string author;
      uint book_id;
   }
   Book book;

   function setBook() public {
      book = Book('Learn Java', 'TP', 1);
   }
   function getBookId() public view returns (uint) {
      return book.book_id;
   }
}
```

# Mapping

Mapping is a reference type as arrays and structs.

```solidity
mapping(_KeyType => _ValueType)
```

- **`_KeyType`:** can be any built-in types plus bytes and string. No reference type or complex objects are allowed.
- **`_ValueType`:** can be any type.

Mapping can only have type of **storage** and are generally used for state variables.

Mapping can be marked public. Solidity automatically create getter for it.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract LedgerBalance {
   mapping(address => uint) public balances;
   //keeps track of the balance for each user.

   function updateBalance(uint newBalance) public {
      balances[msg.sender] = newBalance;
   }
}
//caller of the function
contract Updater {
   function updateBalance() public returns (uint) {
      LedgerBalance ledgerBalance = new LedgerBalance();
      ledgerBalance.updateBalance(10);
      return ledgerBalance.balances(address(this));
   }
}
```

or

```solidity
contract LedgerBalance {
   mapping(address => uint) public balances;

   // This is an event
   event BalanceUpdated(address indexed user, uint newBalance);

   // This function updates the balance and emits an event
   function updateBalance(uint newBalance) public {
      balances[msg.sender] = newBalance;
      emit BalanceUpdated(msg.sender, newBalance);
   }

}
```

# Conversions

## Explicit

We can explicitly convert a data type to another using constructor syntax.

```solidity
int8 y = -3;
uint x = uint(y);
```

Conversion to smaller type costs higher order bits.

```
uint32 a = 0x12345678;
uint16 b = uint16(a); // b = 0x5678
```

Conversion to higher type adds padding bits to the left.

```
uint16 a = 0x1234;
uint32 b = uint32(a); // b = 0x00001234
```

Conversion to smaller byte costs higher order data.

```
bytes2 a = 0x1234;
bytes1 b = bytes1(a); // b = 0x12
```

Conversion to larger byte add padding bits to the right.

```
bytes2 a = 0x1234;
bytes4 b = bytes4(a); // b = 0x12340000
```

Conversion between fixed size bytes and int is only possible when both are of same size.

```
bytes2 a = 0x1234;
uint32 b = uint16(a); // b = 0x00001234
uint32 c = uint32(bytes4(a)); // c = 0x12340000
uint8 d = uint8(uint16(a)); // d = 0x34
uint8 e = uint8(bytes1(a)); // e = 0x12
```

Hexadecimal numbers can be assigned to any integer type if no truncation is needed.

```
uint8 a = 12; // no error
uint32 b = 1234; // no error
uint16 c = 0x123456; // error, as truncation required to 0x3456
```

## Implicit

# Ether Units

In solidity we can use wei, finney, szabo or ether as a suffix to a literal to be used to convert various ether based denominations. Lowest unit is wei and 1e12 represents 1 x 1012.

```
assert(1 wei == 1);
assert(1 szabo == 1e12);
assert(1 finney == 1e15);
assert(1 ether == 1e18);
assert(2 ether == 2000 fenny);
```

## **Time Units**

Similar to currency, Solidity has time units where lowest unit is second and we can use seconds, minutes, hours, days and weeks as suffix to denote time.

```
assert(1 seconds == 1);
assert(1 minutes == 60 seconds);
assert(1 hours == 60 minutes);
assert(1 day == 24 hours);
assert(1 week == 7 days);
```

# Style Guide

- **Indentation** − Use 4 spaces instead of tab to maintain indentation level. Avoid mixing spaces with tabs.
- **Two Blank Lines Rule** − Use 2 Blank lines between two contract definitions.
- **One Blank Line Rule** − Use 1 Blank line between two functions. In case of only declaration, no need to have blank lines.
- **Maximum Line Length** − A single line should not cross 79 characters so that readers can easily parse the code.
- **Wrapping rules** − First argument be in new line without opening parenthesis. Use single indent per argument. Terminating element ); should be the last one.
- **Source Code Encoding** − UTF-8 or ASCII encoding is to be used preferably.
- **Imports** − Import statements should be placed at the top of the file just after pragma declaration.
- **Order of Functions** − Functions should be grouped as per their visibility.
- **Avoid extra whitespaces** − Avoid whitespaces immediately inside parenthesis, brackets or braces.
- **Control structures** − Braces should open on same line as declaration. Close on their own line maintaining the same indentation. Use a space with opening brace.
- **Function Declaration** − Use the above rule for braces. Always add a visibility label. Visibility label should come first before any custom modifier.
- **Mappings** − Avoid whitespaces while declaring mapping variables.
- **Variable declaration** − Avoid whitespaces while declaring array variables.
- **String declaration** − Use double quotes to declare a string instead of single quote.

## **Order of Layout**

- Pragma statements
- Import statements
- Interfaces
- Libraries
- Contracts

Within Interfaces, libraries or contracts the order should be as −

- Type declarations
- State variables
- Events
- Functions

# **constructor**

initializes state variables (variables that are permanently stored on the Ethereum blockchain.) of the contract, Used to store data in blockchain. 

executed only once during the contract deployment process. It cannot be called or executed again after deployment. This ensures that the initial setup of the contract is performed securely and cannot be altered.

**Access Control:** You can use the **`constructor`** to establish access control within your contract. For example, you can set the owner of a contract in the constructor, and only the owner can perform certain privileged actions.

```jsx
constructor() 
{
    //body
}
```

---

# Func creation and call

```jsx
function set(uint amt) external //write
{
amount=amt;
}
Function get()external view returns(uint) //read
{
return value;
}
```

---

# Built in variables

msg.sender

- It will return the address that
has called smart contract

msg.value (in wei)

- It will return the eth that is sent
by the sender

tx.origin

- It will return the address that
has called smart contract

Block.timestamp

- Returns the current timestamp
