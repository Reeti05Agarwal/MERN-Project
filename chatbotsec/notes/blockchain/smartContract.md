# Smart Contract

A blockchain-encoded digital contract between two or more parties is known as a smart contract. The conditions of the agreement between the buyer and seller are directly encoded into lines of code, making it a self-executing contract. The contract cannot be changed after it is deployed since both the code and the agreements it contains are on a decentralized blockchain network.

The transparency of smart contracts is one of its most important benefits. A smart contract's execution results in its recording on the blockchain, where it is accessible to everybody on the network. This openness makes sure that everyone participating in the deal has the same information at their disposal and that the provisions of the contract are strictly adhered to.

There are several applications for smart contracts, including supply chain management, real estate transactions, and digital identity verification. The banking sector is one area where smart contracts are becoming more and more popular. Banks and other financial institutions are investigating the use of smart contracts to automate many of their current procedures, including clearing and settlement, in order to cut down on time and expenses.

# Disadvantages

Standardization of smart contract

Despite all of its advantages, smart contracts are not without drawbacks. The absence of standards is one major problem. Since smart contracts are a relatively new kind of technology, they are not required to go by any particular set of norms or guidelines. Due to the absence of standardization, it may be challenging for various blockchains' smart contracts to communicate with one another.

The potential for bugs or other weaknesses in the code is another difficulty. Any flaws or weaknesses in the code might have serious repercussions because smart contracts are self-executing and cannot be changed once they are deployed. To reduce these risks, developers must make sure that the code is extensively tested and audited.

# Use Cases

## supply chain management

Smart contracts may also be used to carry out intricate corporate procedures. A smart contract, for instance, may automate the tracking of items from the manufacturer to the customer in supply chain management. The smart contract updates the ledger each time the products are exchanged, guaranteeing that everyone in the supply chain has access to the same data.

## Digital identity verification

Digital identity verification may also be accomplished with smart contracts. The blockchain may be used to store a person's identifying data in a smart contract. Anyone on the network may then access and verify this information. As a result, there is no longer a need for centralized identity verification agencies, and the likelihood of identity fraud is decreased.

## Decentralized finance (DeFi)

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is another area where smart contracts may be used. DeFi is a term used to describe financial apps created using blockchain technology. Automating financial procedures like lending, borrowing, and trading is possible using smart contracts.
