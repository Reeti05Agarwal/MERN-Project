# Prove of work (POW)

Proof of Work(PoW) is the **original consensus algorithm** in a blockchain network. The algorithm is used to confirm the transaction and creates a new block to the chain. In this algorithm, **minors** (a group of people) compete against each other to complete the transaction on the network. The process of competing against each other is called **mining**. As soon as miners successfully created a valid block, he gets **rewarded**. The most famous application of Proof of Work(PoW) is Bitcoin.
