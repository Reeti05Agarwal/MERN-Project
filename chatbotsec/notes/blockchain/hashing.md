# Blockchain Hash Function

A hash function takes an input string (numbers, alphabets, media files) of any length and transforms it into a fixed length. The fixed bit length can vary (like 32-bit or 64-bit or 128-bit or 256-bit) depending on the hash function which is being used.

1. It produces a unique output (or hash).
2. It is a one-way function.

# Blockchain Block Hashing

 block hash may be thought of as a special identification number that is given to each block on the blockchain. Its like a unique block fingerprints

In the above image, the generated hash would look like 00001acbm010gfh1010xxx. I'd like to point out that this hash has four leading zeros. The four leading zero's describes whether the block is valid or not. For practical purposes, you will see that this hash is corresponding to the nonce, and the block number is corresponding to the available data. Since the hash has four leading zeroes, therefore, it is a valid block. If the newly generating hash does not have four leading zeroes, then it will not a valid block. To make the block valid, we will do it by using the field called **nonce (Number Used Once)**.

## nonce

A nonce is basically a random number which figures out how you can actually make this specific block provide you with a valid hash. The way you can do this is by changing the nonce manually. Generally, the miner starts with a Nonce value of 1 and keeps on incrementing it until the generated hash meets the specified criterion. Thus, it may take several iterations until the desired hash with four leading zeros is generated. The expected time for generating a block in the [bitcoin](https://www.javatpoint.com/bitcoin) system is 10 minutes. Once the miner successfully mines the block, he releases that block in the system and making it the last block in the chain.


## Hashing Function

A cryptographic hash function is used to create the block hash whenever a new block is added to the blockchain. This function generates a fixed-size output after taking in the block's contents, including the transaction data, timestamp, and preceding block hash.

The block header is then updated to include this output in addition to other details like the nonce value and the current blockchain protocol version. A final block hash is then generated by performing another hash on the block header.

The block hash is then sent out to the network to be confirmed by other blockchain nodes. This verification procedure comprises determining if the block hash satisfies a set of predetermined standards, such as the degree of difficulty of the employed proof-of-work algorithm.
